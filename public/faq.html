          <h5 class="fw-bold">How old is SAIL?</h5>
          <p>SAIL is rebranded ksquirrel-libs rewritten in C, improved and with high-level APIs. Ksquirrel-libs was a set of C++ image codecs
             for the KSquirrel image viewer. See <a href="http://ksquirrel.sourceforge.net">http://ksquirrel.sourceforge.net</a>.</a>
          <p>Technically, SAIL (ksquirrel-libs) was founded in 2003 making it one of the oldest image decoding libraries.</p>

        <a name="is-sail-cross-platform"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Is SAIL cross-platform?</h5>
          <p>Yes. It's written in pure C11 and is highly portable. However, only the Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
             are officially supported. SAIL may or may not compile on other platforms. Pull requests to support more platforms are highly welcomed.</p>

        <a name="describe-the-high-level-apis"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Describe the high-level APIs</h5>
          <p>SAIL provides four levels of high-level APIs:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>Junior</code> - I just want to load this JPEG from a file or memory</li>
            <li><code>Advanced</code> - I want to load this animated GIF from a file or memory</li>
            <li><code>Deep diver</code> - I want to load this animated GIF from a file or memory and have control over selected codecs and meta data</li>
            <li><code>Technical diver</code> - I want everything above and my custom I/O source</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <a name="does-sail-provide-simple-single-line-apis"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Does SAIL provide simple single-line APIs?</h5>
          <p>Yes. SAIL provides four levels of APIs, depending on your needs: <code>junior</code>, <code>advanced</code>,
             <code>deep diver</code>, and <code>technical diver</code>. <code>Junior</code> API is what you want.</p>
        </div>

        <a name="in-what-pixel-format-sail-loading-functions-output-images"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">In what pixel format SAIL loading functions output images?</h5>
          <p></p>
          <p>SAIL always tries to output pixel format close to the source pixel format as much as possible.
             Ideally (but not always), it outputs the same pixel format as stored in the image.</p>
          <p>For example, SAIL outputs BPP24-BGR images from full-color BMP files without transparency.<p>
          <p>You can also consider conversion functions from <code>libsail-manip</code>.<p>
        </div>

        <a name="what-pixel-formats-can-sail-save"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">What pixel formats can SAIL save?</h5>
          <p>SAIL codecs always try to support as much output pixel formats as possible. SAIL doesn't convert
             one pixel format to another in saving operations. Images are always written as is.</p>
          <p>The list of pixel formats that can be written by SAIL is codec-specific and is publicly available in every
             .codec.info file. It can be accessed through <code>sail_codec_info_from_extension() -> codec_info -> save_features ->
             pixel_formats</code>.</p>
        </div>

        <a name="does-sail-support-animated-and-multi-paged-images"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Does SAIL support animated and multi-paged images?</h5>
          <p>Yes. Just continue loading the image file until the loading functions return <code>SAIL_OK</code>.
             If no more frames are available, the loading functions return <code>SAIL_ERROR_NO_MORE_FRAMES</code>.</p>
        </div>

        <a name="does-sail-support-loading-from-memory"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Does SAIL support loading from memory?</h5>
          <p>Yes. SAIL supports loading/saving from/to files and memory. For technical divers,
             it's also possible to use custom I/O sources.</p>
          <p>See <code>sail_start_loading_from_file()</code>, <code>sail_start_loading_from_memory()</code>, and <code>sail_start_loading_from_io()</code>.</p>
        </div>

        <a name="how-does-sail-support-image-formats"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">How does SAIL support image formats?</h5>
          <p>SAIL supports image formats through dynamically loaded SAIL codecs (unless compiled with <code>SAIL_COMBINE_CODECS</code>).
             End-users never work with the codecs directly. They always work with the abstract high-level APIs.</p>
        </div>

        <a name="does-sail-preload-codecs-in-the-initialization-routine"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Does SAIL preload codecs in the initialization routine?</h5>
          <p>
            <h6 class="fw-bold">SAIL_COMBINE_CODECS is OFF</h6>
            <p>SAIL doesn't preload codecs in the initialization routine (<code>sail_init()</code>). It loads them on demand.
               However, you can preload them explicitly with <code>sail_init_with_flags(SAIL_FLAG_PRELOAD_CODECS)</code>.</p>
            <h6 class="fw-bold">SAIL_COMBINE_CODECS is ON</h6>
            <p>All codecs get loaded on application startup.</p>
          </p>
        </div>

        <a name="how-does-sail-look-for-codecs"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">How does SAIL look for codecs?</h5>

              <code>&lt;FOUND PATH&gt;/lib</code> is added to <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>.
            </p>
          </p>
          <p>On all platforms, <code>SAIL_THIRD_PARTY_CODECS_PATH</code> environment variable with a list of ';'-separated paths
             is searched if SAIL was compiled with <code>SAIL_THIRD_PARTY_CODECS_PATH</code> enabled (the default), so you can
             load your own codecs from there.</p>
        </div>

        <a name="how-can-i-point-sail-to-my-custom-codecs"></a>
        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">How can I point SAIL to my custom codecs?</h5>
          <p>If SAIL was compiled with <code>SAIL_THIRD_PARTY_CODECS_PATH</code> enabled (the default), you can set
             the <code>SAIL_THIRD_PARTY_CODECS_PATH</code> environment variable to a list of ';'-separated paths
             containing your custom SAIL codecs.</p>
          <p>On Windows, <code>sail.dll location</code> and <code>SAIL_THIRD_PARTY_CODECS_PATH/lib</code> are the only
             places where DLL dependencies are searched. No other paths are searched. Use WIN32 API <code>AddDllDirectory</code>
             to add your own DLL dependencies search path. On other platforms, <code>SAIL_THIRD_PARTY_CODECS_PATH/lib</code>
             is added to <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> in runtime.</p>
          <p>If SAIL was compiled with <code>SAIL_THIRD_PARTY_CODECS_PATH</code> disabled, loading third-party codecs is disabled.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">I'd like to reorganize the standard SAIL folder layout on Windows (for standalone build or bundle)</h5>
          <p>You can surely do that. With the standard layout SAIL detects the codecs' location automatically.
             If you reorganize the standard SAIL folder layout, you'll need to specify the new codecs' location by
             setting the <code>SAIL_CODECS_PATH</code> environment variable.</p>

          <h5 class="fw-bold">Describe the memory management techniques implemented in SAIL</h5>
          <h6 class="fw-bold">The memory management technique implemented in SAIL</h6>
          <p>Internally, SAIL always cleans up on errors. If you encounter a memory leak on error, please report it.</p>
          <p><span class="fw-bold">C only:</span> However, if an engineer encounters an error in the middle of loading
             or saving an image with the <code>advanced</code> or a deeper API, it's always a responsibility of the engineer
             to stop loading or saving with <code>sail_stop_loading()</code> or <code>sail_stop_saving()</code>.
             These functions execute a proper cleanup in the underlying codec. If you don't call <code>sail_stop_loading()</code>
             or <code>sail_stop_saving()</code> in this situation, be prepared for memory leaks.</p>
             <p><span class="fw-bold">C++ only:</span> C++ engineers are more lucky. The C++ binding executes the necessary
                cleanup automatically in this situation in <code>~image_input()</code> or <code>~image_output()</code>.</p>
          <h6 class="fw-bold">Convention to call SAIL functions</h6>
          <p>It's always recommended (but not required) to use the <code>SAIL_TRY()</code> macro to call SAIL functions.
             It's also always recommended to clean up on error with the <code>SAIL_TRY_OR_CLEANUP()</code> macro if you need to.</p>
          <h6 class="fw-bold">External pointers stay untouched on error</h6>
          <p>External pointers that are allocated or modified by SAIL functions stay untouched on error. For example:
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">struct sail_image *image = NULL;
SAIL_TRY(sail_alloc_image(&image));

/*
 * If sail_alloc_palette_for_data() fails, the palette pointer stays untouched (NULL).
 * This code prints NULL value on error.
 */
SAIL_TRY_OR_CLEANUP(sail_alloc_palette_for_data(SAIL_PIXEL_FORMAT_BPP24_RGB, color_count, &image->palette));
                    /* cleanup */ printf("%p\n", image->palette),
                                  sail_destroy_image(image));</code></pre>
            <hr/>
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">void *state = NULL;
struct sail_image *image = NULL;

SAIL_TRY(sail_start_loading_from_file(..., &state));

/*
 * If sail_load_next_frame() fails, the image pointer stays untouched (NULL).
 * This code prints NULL value on error.
 */
SAIL_TRY_OR_CLEANUP(sail_load_next_frame(state, &image),
                    /* cleanup */ printf("%p\n", image),
                                  sail_stop_loading(state));</code></pre>
          </p>
          <h6 class="fw-bold">Always set a pointer to state to NULL (C only)</h6>
          <p>C loading and saving functions require a local void pointer to save state. Always set it to NULL before
             loading or saving. For example:
            <pre><code class="language-cpp">void *state = NULL;

SAIL_TRY(sail_start_loading_from_file(..., &state));

SAIL_TRY_OR_CLEANUP(sail_load_next_frame(state, ...),

        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Can I implement an image codec in C++?</h5>
          <p>Yes. Your codec just needs to export a set of public functions so SAIL can recognize and use it.

# Possible values:
#    STATIC      - Can save static images.
#    ANIMATED    - Can save animated images.
#    MULTI-PAGED - Can save multi-paged (but not animated) images.
#    META-DATA   - Can save image meta data like JPEG comments or EXIF.
#    INTERLACED  - Can save interlaced images.
#    ICCP        - Can save embedded ICC profiles.

# Tuning options' names must start with the codec name to avoid confusing.
#
# The list of possible values for every tuning option is not current available

          <h5 class="fw-bold">Can I compile codecs dependencies (like libjpeg) directly into SAIL?</h5>
          <p>Unlike FreeImage, SAIL doesn't allow compiling external dependencies into a single library and I have no plans to allow that.</p>
          <p>You can still achieve that using external build systems like <code>vcpkg</code>.</p>
          <p>If you prefer compiling SAIL manually as a shared library, you can compile it against the static vcpkg triplet like <code>x64-windows-static</code>. For example:</p>
          <pre><code class="language-bash"># Install vcpkg using the official installation guide into your preferred path.
# For example, into F:/vcpkg.

# Install SAIL in vcpkg just to install all its dependencies
# as static libs. We'll compile SAIL manually later.
cd F:/vcpkg/
vcpkg install sail[all] --triplet x64-windows-static

# Go to the cloned SAIL sources
cd F:/sail/

# Compile SAIL against vcpkg
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DSAIL_COMBINE_CODECS=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=F:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static ..
cmake --build . --config Release</code></pre>

          <p>This way all codecs and their dependencies will be compiled into <code>sail-codecs.dll</code>.</p>

        <div>
          <h5 class="fw-bold">Are there any bindings to other programming languages?</h5>
          <p>Yes. Currently SAIL supports the following bindings:
            <ol>
              <li>C++</li>
            </ol>
            Pull requests to support more programming languages are highly welcomed.

          <p>Ksquirrel-libs supported around 60 image formats. I have no plans to port them all. However,
             the most popular image formats will be definitely ported from ksquirrel-libs.</p>
